## Overview

Quantum error correction is essential for building practical, large-scale quantum computers. This repository serves as a resource for understanding and evaluating the various open-source frameworks available for implementing and researching QEC codes, decoders, and error mitigation techniques.

## What is Quantum Error Correction?

Quantum Error Correction (QEC) addresses the critical challenge of maintaining accurate quantum information despite the inherent fragility of qubits. Unlike classical error correction, QEC must handle:

- **Bit-flip errors**: Transitions between |0‚ü© and |1‚ü© states
- **Phase-flip errors**: Changes to the relative phase of quantum states
- **Decoherence**: Loss of quantum properties over time

QEC works by encoding logical qubits across multiple physical qubits using quantum entanglement and superposition, allowing errors to be detected and corrected without collapsing the quantum state.
