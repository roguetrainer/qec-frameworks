ðŸš€ Exciting times in quantum error correction! ðŸŽ‰

I'm thrilled to share my new repository exploring the amazing open-source QEC frameworks that are accelerating our path to fault-tolerant quantum computing: https://github.com/roguetrainer/qec-frameworks

It's genuinely inspiring to see companies like [Entropica Labs](https://www.linkedin.com/company/entropica-labs) and [Riverlane](https://www.linkedin.com/company/river-lane-research-ltd) generously creating such excellent and capable open-source frameworks! ðŸ™Œ

ðŸ”¬ Entropica Labs' **Loom Design** provides an intuitive toolkit for designing, simulating, and validating QEC codes - making quantum error correction visual and accessible for developers, researchers, and students alike.

âš¡ Riverlane's **Deltakit** is the first open-source platform combining an SDK with an interactive textbook, enabling developers to learn, experiment with, and adopt real-time quantum error correction. It's a game-changer for building QEC expertise!

These companies are democratizing access to sophisticated QEC tools and helping build the skilled quantum workforce we need. Their commitment to open-source innovation is exactly what the quantum ecosystem needs to thrive! ðŸ’¡

A huge thank you to both teams for their contributions to the community. The future of quantum computing is looking brighter because of efforts like these! âœ¨
